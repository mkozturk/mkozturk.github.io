Iâ€™m a data scientist based in Istanbul and TekirdaÄŸ, where I share my life with my family and our beloved cats.

My training is in physics, culminating with a PhD in magnetospheric physics. For over a decade, I taught at various universities, designing and leading programming courses and guiding students and teaching assistants alike. Eventually, I transitioned from academia to pursue an exciting career in data science.

I'm a proud alumnus of Ä°stanbul Erkek Lisesi (1991), BoÄŸaziÃ§i University (B.Sc. 1996, M.Sc 1999), and Rice University (PhD 2004).

This site is mainly about my [technical notes](blog.html). For the interested, I have written a number of pieces in other websites (all in Turkish):

* [Yalansavar](https://yalansavar.org/author/mkoz/): Scientific skepticism
* [AÃ§Ä±k Bilim](http://www.acikbilim.com/author/kaanozturk): Popular science
* [Veri Defteri](http://www.veridefteri.com/author/kaan/): Data science, machine learning, programming.
* [BirGÃ¼n Gazetesi](https://www.birgun.net/profil/m-kaan-ozturk-344): Biweekly column on scientific skepticism
* [Wordpress Blog](https://mkoz.wordpress.com/): My other personal blog
