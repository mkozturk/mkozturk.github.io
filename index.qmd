I am a senior data scientist, currently working at [Kavaken](https://www.kavaken.com/), developing predictive analytics tools for wind turbines. I live in Istanbul and Tekirdağ with my family and our three cats.

My training is in physics, with a PhD in magnetospheric physics. I have taught in various universities for more than a decade, before leaving academia altogether for a career in data science.

I'm a proud alumnus of İstanbul Erkek Lisesi, Boğaziçi University, and Rice University.

This site is mainly about my technical notes. For the interested, I have written a number of pieces in other websites (all in Turkish):

* [Yalansavar](https://yalansavar.org/author/mkoz/): Scientific skepticism
* [Açık Bilim](http://www.acikbilim.com/author/kaanozturk): Popular science
* [Veri Defteri](http://www.veridefteri.com/author/kaan/): Data science, machine learning, programming.
* [BirGün Gazetesi](https://www.birgun.net/profil/m-kaan-ozturk-344): Biweekly column on scientific skepticism
* [Wordpress Blog](https://mkoz.wordpress.com/): My other personal blog
